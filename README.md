   Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects a person’s thinking ability. The symptoms of Schizophrenia include hallucination, delusions, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior and lack of motivation. There is no specific reason for the cause of Schizophrenia but the possible factors of this disease are physical, genetic, psychological, environmental impacts, drug addiction and inappropriate development of the Brain. Severe condition of this disorder leads to suicide. It is evaluated that one person out of two hundred individuals will be affected by Schizophrenia at some point during their lifetime. Currently, there are no specific laboratory tests or clinical equipment to diagnose Schizophrenia. Machine Learning plays a key role in the healthcare domain where there is a need for mental disorder prediction. The brain state is the main factor to detect Schizophrenia so Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used for examining the brain. Datasets are taken COBRE(The Center for Biomedical Research Excellence). These datasets contain patient records with multiscale brain parcellations(fMRI). Data Preprocessing is used to extract Phenotypic Data (all kinds of clinical information regarding patients' disease symptoms, as well as relevant demographic data, such as age, ethnicity, and sex) from Raw fMRI. We have used several Deep learning models. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) is one of  the successful image classification and recognition models that results in high accuracy. CNN is made up of hidden layers that receive inputs as MRI images and are used to determine complex patterns. There are several diseases like bipolar disorder, Parkinson’s disease which have symptoms similar to Schizophrenia. In these scenarios, highly efficient supervised algorithms are better in classifying Schizophrenia patients from other patients. Out of various Supervised Machine learning Algorithms, Support Vector Machine(SVM) results have high accuracy. Our project aim is to give the obtained results from CNN into SVM to classify and predict Schizophrenia patients.
